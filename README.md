## Scrum Methodology
For the development of PlanetZe, we used the **Agile Scrum framework** to manage the project efficiently and ensure a collaborative and iterative process. The team worked in two sprints, focusing on key features such as carbon tracking, eco-friendly habits, emissions offsetting, and a visually appealing dashboard. We used Jira to track user stories and monitor progress, ensuring that tasks were completed on time and aligned with the project's goals.

By employing Scrum, we were able to break down complex features into manageable chunks and maintain flexibility throughout the development process. Regular sprint meetings and daily stand-ups kept the team aligned and allowed us to quickly address challenges, ultimately resulting in a well-rounded and functional app that meets users' needs.
## Backend
For the backend of PlanetZe, we chose **Firebase** for its powerful, scalable, and secure capabilities. **Firebase Authentication** ensures a seamless and secure user experience by handling user login, sign-up, email verification, and password resets with ease. This made managing user credentials both reliable and efficient.

We also used **Firebase Realtime Database** to store and sync user information in real-time. This ensures that updates, like changes in carbon footprint, progress on eco-habits, or the amount of carbon emissions offset, are instantly reflected for users. Firebase's ability to handle data in real-time kept the app responsive and ensured that users always had the latest information at their fingertips. With Firebase’s scalability and security, PlanetZe is equipped to grow with our user base while keeping data secure and accessible.
## Design
The app’s user interface (UI) was initially designed using Figma, adhering to the company’s color palette to create a cohesive and visually appealing experience.
